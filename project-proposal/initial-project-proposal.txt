Initial Project Proposal

Goal: What are the goals of the project (the intended result)?

The goal of my project is to build a classifier that will predict a song’s musical genre relative to its lyrical content. 

computational/human classification should be interesting as it is relatively subjective

Data: What data will you be using, and how (and/or from where) will you obtain it?

Billboard charts for musical genre labels: classification based on key fan interactions with music, including album sales and downloads, track downloads, radio airplay and touring as well as streaming and social interactions on Facebook, Twitter, Vevo, Youtube, Spotify and other popular online destinations for music.

Methods: What are the methods being uses to achieve the goal? If you are going to explore a few options indicate which ones and how you will go about deciding among them.

k-nearest neighbors kNN classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks

Timeline: Sketch out a rough timeline with 3-5 milestones between now and May 19.

Milestone 1: Write programs to gather data and tag the songs with the musical genre
Milestone 2: Preliminary project Presentation 
Milestone 3: Implement classifier and discern relevant features 
Milestone 4: Make conclusions based on results and do the paper
